                HORSE
            </h3>
            <p>
                The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is a domesticated one-toed hoofed mammal. It belongs to the
                taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over
                the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed
                animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed
                to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some
                domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild
                horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated.

                LION
            </h3>
            <p>
                The lion (Panthera leo) is a large felid of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a
                muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
                It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a
                social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related
                females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The
                lion is an apex and keystone predator;
